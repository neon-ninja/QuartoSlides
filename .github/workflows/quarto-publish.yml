# This workflow will detect pushes to the main branch, and build qmd files to HTML
# The built HTML files are published to the gh-pages branch
# The gh-pages branch can then be published to GitHub Pages by a different action

# This action is based on https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/blob/main/examples/quarto-publish-example.yml
